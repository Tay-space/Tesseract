## Disclaimer: This is a very early build and there's a ton of work that needs to be done.

[Tesseract Client](/Tesseract_Client.png)

### What is the Tesseract client?

A customizable desktop client (or wallet but I prefer to call Tesseract a client) for Ethereum created with Python, Web3.py, and dearpygui. This client will also be used with the dapp that I'm creating.

### Why though?

Because web browsers are exploited quite a bit and I like being different.

---

### Setup

There aren't that many dependencies needed and all of them can be installed with pip.

`pip install web3 dearpygui eth-account`

2. There's several environment variables that need to be set depending on what network you want to connect to etc. (In progress)

---

### Starting the app

`python3 tesseract_client.py`
